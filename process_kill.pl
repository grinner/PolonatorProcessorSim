# Kills acqiusition-associated processes running on either the acquisition
# computer (by passing "acq" as the first argument) or the processing
# computer (by passing "proc" as the argument).  If running on the acq, 
# will execute the complete-scan routine after killing the processes.

# These lists define the names of the processes to kill.  We iterate over this list,
# and for each entry, kill all running processes matching the current list element.
# Then, we re-call ps to get a new process list, and kill all processes matching the
# next element in the list
# Note the order below is important -- parents must be killed before children, since
# parents can spawn new children
