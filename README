This is a simulator for the original polonator processing pipeline.
It does the following
1) removes the original TCP/IP communication wiht the acquisition machine
2) Tidies up the code for readability and organization
3) uses a data file set from the polonator G.007 for input to create the object
table and does a run of sequencing
4) Use creatImageDataSet.py to create the input text files by running it in 
each *.raw image directory to create an entire set of input images.

Get a pre-indexed group of test images at:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15200497/raw_img.zip

Move test images into a subdirectory in this directory named raw_img.


raw_img/
    00_00_cy3/
    00_00_cy5/
    00_00_fam/
    00_00_txr/
    AM1a_A/
    AM1a_C/
    AM1a_G/
    AM1a_T/
    
    
In addition, make sure you create the following subdirectories

autoexp_images/
beads/
bin/
images/
logs/
qc/
tetrahedra/
    
Run these files in this directory with: 

python launcher.py
